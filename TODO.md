- chooser-slot YES-MAYBE-NO system (by having a "not-assigned" choice for each slot)
- sub- and superset constraints (dependent choices become a graph -> dominating sets for integer variable allocation)
- SlotHasSize -> SlotCount (counting occurences of elements of a given set)
- Critical set as bitsets / do you need simplification?
